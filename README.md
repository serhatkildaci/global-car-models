This repository contains a comprehensive list of vehicle models, organized by brand. The data is available in three formats: CSV, JSON, and YAML.

## üöó Features

- **Comprehensive Data**: Extensive list of vehicle models from various manufacturers
- **Multiple Formats**: Available in JSON, CSV, and YAML formats
- **Auto-Sync**: GitHub Actions automatically keeps all formats synchronized
- **Open Source**: MIT licensed and community-driven
- **Easy Integration**: Simple data formats for easy integration into projects

## Automation

This repository is fully automated using GitHub Actions. When you update and push a change to any of the data files (`data/models.json`, `data/models.csv`, or `data/models.yaml`), a workflow is triggered to automatically update the other two formats.

This ensures that all three data files remain in sync.

## Data Formats

### JSON (`data/models.json`)

The JSON file is structured as a dictionary where each key is a vehicle brand and the value is a list of models for that brand.

```json
{
    "Abarth": [
        "124 Spider",
        "500",
        "595",
        "695",
        "Punto Evo"
    ],
    "Acura": [
        "CL",
        "CSX",
        ...
    ]
}
```

### CSV (`data/models.csv`)

The CSV file contains two columns: `brand` and `model`.

```csv
brand,model
Abarth,124 Spider
Abarth,500
...
```

### YAML (`data/models.yaml`)

The YAML file has a structure similar to the JSON file.

```yaml
Abarth:
- 124 Spider
- 500
...
```
